    "Title": "Generating text messages using speech recognition in a vehicle navigation system",
    "Abstract": "A vehicle navigation system may send and receive communications such as text messages. Speech recognition may generate a text message without affecting a driver&#39;s control of the vehicle. A user may audibly control the navigation system and generate a text message through a speech recognition element. A microphone may record a user&#39;s voice which is then transformed into a text message for transmission. The message may be recorded sentence-by-sentence word-by-word or letter-by-letter. The recorded text message may be visually or audibly presented to the user before transmission."
